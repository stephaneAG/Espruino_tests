The following table results of the few tests ran when writing the related code ( hosted in this repo ).  

The tests were conducted using "standard" 5V input voltage sources ( providing 500mA from usb & 1A from a wall outlet ).  

Remember that for most devices, the "screen state" alters the current drawn by the device:  
it 'll increase rapidly before decreasing slowly after the screen is no longer lit, down to the power comsumption of the device ( be it charging or charged ).  

Also, please bear in mind that in the current state of the hardware, the values are indicated are not "lab-grade" ones ( better resolution may be achieved with different hardware setups ).
